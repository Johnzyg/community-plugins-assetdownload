# Asset downloader

This plugin provides a gui for downloading community assets from within MakeHuman. When installed, you will get a new tab "community" with a subtab "assets" inside MakeHuman.

## Installation

To use this, you also need to install [MHAPI](https://github.com/makehumancommunity/community-plugins-mhapi). 

To install, copy the directories 1_MHAPI (from the MHAPI repo) and 8_assetdownload to the "plugins" directory under where you installed MakeHuman. On windows this is 
where you unzipped MH. On Linux this is likely /usr/share/makehuman/plugins. 

When you start MH the next time, the plugin should run automatically.
